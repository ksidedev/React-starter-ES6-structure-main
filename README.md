# Spark React Starter

A starter kit for creating React components for the Spark web ecosystem.

- JS components implemented using React classes or stateless components
- CSS / styling implemented using SASS/SCSS or plain CSS
- CSS Modules is enabled, so styling will be scoped per component by default

To run the dev environment firstly use:

```npm start```

and to create a static (prod-style) build use:

```npm run build:prod```

Running the dev build will create a local server with hot reloading through webpack as well as a live linter for any code you edit while the server is running.
